    <h2><u>LoT Apps:</u></h2>
    <P> Applications: In this first part of the class we spoke about the IoT applications. From the application of IoT to the examples and features.<br>

      This task was about brain stomring ideas about what is an LoT application with the group. 
      Our group came up with multiple sulotions consisting of:<br>
      Connecting data and statistics to the rest of the world to enable a more efficient and optimized way to achieve day to day tasks in a more automated way.<br></li>
      Collecting datat and storing in local and cloud servers. <br><br>
      Then we went on to discuss some examples of LoT which are Smart poewr plugs, locks, doors, watches, lights and many more similar items.<br>
      The idea here was to list the best examples of IoT applications in the real world as we know it.<br> 
      Following we discussed how to and what some of the features might be:
       The Application on the LoT needs to be inteligent and has a user interface. Plus the Computer-to-comouter communications is needed to opporate such device      
    </P>
    <h2><u>Smart Buildings:</u></h2>
    <p>
    In this section we discussed 3 topics which were "what does smart mean", "Smart building scenarios" and "Needed features".
    <br>
    Our combined solutions were that "smart" means a way to automate tasks while removing the humans out of the processing equation to reduce errors. 
    Smart building scenario can be lighting - detecting and motion and turning on or off lights accordingly. key card access which can then turn on certain applications that the particular user has predetermined to be automated upon entry. 
    The features that are required to achieve such samrt building are as following:
    <ul>
      <li>Sensor detection/inputs</li>
      <li>Data collection/storage</li>
      <li>learn behavioural patterns</li>
      <li>Processing power</li>
      <li>output(perform required task)</li>
    </ul>
    
    </p>
    <h2><u>LoT Interfaces</u></h2>
    <p>
      For the interfaces portion we discussed the "features", "users" and "parts needed". These three topics really helped fine tune my understanding of LoT and how it is applicable/used in every day life. <br>
      The high level features are the ability and monitor the smart building, such as the CO2 levels, gas, light, tempetature(inside and outside), sun/rain and wind levels.<br>
      With all this data collected we can really achive a very smart home that will be able to reduce living and or operating costs.
      From there we continued to discuss the users that the smart home might be interacting with. These are most likely to be the public entering the building, security guards, staff, students, emergency services and many more. 
      The last part for the control interfaces was the parts needed to create such building. For this we agreed on the following:
      <ul>
        <li>Sensors</li>
        <li>Data storage(servers)</li>
        <li>Processing computer(local or remote)</li>
        <li>Code/Scripts</li>
        <li>Humans to monitor building operation and functionality</li>
     </ul>
    </p>

    <h3><u>LoT Applications:</u></h3>

      <ol>
          <li>Smart watch</li>
          <li>Smart kettle</li>
          <li>Smart home device (such as google home)</li>
          <li>Inteligent AC controller</li>
          <li>Security system</li>
          <li>building fire protection system</li>
          <li>Health monitoring services</li>
          <li>Smart cities</li>
          <li>Good and services automation services</li>
          <li>Parcel tracking</li>
